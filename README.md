# JTracer (2007)

This is a ray tracer I wrote for the ITC303 Software Engineering subject
project during my Bachelor degree in 2007. It is a command line application
written in C++ using a bespoke scene description language.

It implements the following features:

- Command line interface
- Bespoke scene description language parsed using recursive descent
- Perspective projection
- Point lighting
- Plane, sphere, and cylinder primitives
- Rotation, translation, and scaling transformations
- Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting with shadows and reflections
- Bitmap (.bmp) file output format

## Building

This project was originally developed using Borland C++ Compiler v5.5 and can
be built using the `compile.bat` batch file in the `bin` directory.

## Documentation

The original user manual provided for the assignment is provided in the `doc`
directory.
